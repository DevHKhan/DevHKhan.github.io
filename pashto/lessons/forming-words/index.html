            <h1 class="text-center">Forming Words</h1>

            <p>Now that you are familiar with the Pashto alphabet and diacritics, you will soon be able to learn how to form words.
                The Arabic script (the script that Pashto is based on) has letters that actually change form depending on where
                they are located in a certain word.
            </p>

            <h2>How Do Words Form?</h2>

            <p>Basically, letters are joined and connected together to form different words. The way that these letters appear
                in these words depends on where they are located within the words.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>If a letter appears at the start of a word, it will take on its initial form.</li>
                <li>If a letter appears in the middle of a word, it will take on its medial form.</li>
                <li>If a letter appears at the end of a word, it will take on its final form.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Furthermore, letters typically have understood diacritics on them. However, these diacritics are usually not
                written out, often only showing themselves in dictionaries to help readers achieve the correct pronunciation.
                For the most part, diacritics are meant to be understood by the reader without being explicitly denoted. Below
                is an example of a full word in Pashto.
            </p>
