      <h2 id="about">A Little Bit About Pashto</h2>

      <p>
        Pashto is part of the Iranian division of the Indo-Iranian group of the
        Indo-European language family. It has roughly 45 to 55 million speakers,
        most of whom live in Pakistan and Afghanistan. The ethnic Pashtuns, who
        also make up the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan, claim Pashto as
        their native language.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Learn Pashto?</h2>

      <p>
        If you ever decide to travel to Afghanistan or Pakistan, having Pashto
        in your toolkit will prove to be very useful. It is the first language
        of approximately 40% to 55% of Afghanistan's population, and it is the
        second language of approximately 10% to 28% of Afghanistan's population.
        Roughly 15% of Pakistan's population speaks Pashto.
      </p>

      <p>
        Due to the lack of widespread media, literature, and awareness of
        Pashto, it might seem like Pashto does not have very many speakers.
        However, interestingly, the number of Pashto speakers is roughly double
        the number of Dutch speakers, and Dutch is certainly a respectible
        language! The point is that Pashto has plenty of speakers.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the main contributers to Pashto's lack of influence on today's
        media is the fact that a sizeable portion of Pashto's speakers are
        illiterate or have limited literacy. While more and more efforts are
        being made to increase access to educational opportunities to learn
        Pashto (especially in Afghanistan and Pakistan), there are still many
        Pashto speakers who are not able to read or write Pashto. As a native
        speaker of Pashto who has learned how to read, write, and speak Pashto,
        I thought that I should make this website so that others, whether native
        speakers or not, can learn Pashto to the greatest extent possible.
